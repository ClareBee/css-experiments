This little site is intended as a personal learning log, rather than anything fancy!

I decided to use a first play-around with [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll) and the built-in [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme as a way of tracking progress through [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/)'s book [CSS Secrets](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920031123.do).

<br/>
>In this practical guide, CSS expert Lea Verou provides 47 undocumented techniques and tips to help intermediate-to advanced CSS developers devise elegant solutions to a wide range of everyday web design problems.
