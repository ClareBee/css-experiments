<section>
  <button class="button"><div>Click me</div></button>

  <p>Uses a pseudo-element w z-index of -1 for styling, so as not to skew the content itself!</p>
  <p>Position relative to the parent, position absolute to the generated context. All offsets set to zero means that it stretches horizontally/vertically to the size of the parent (the button)</p>

  <div class="skewy"><div>Unskewed</div><div>Content</div></div>
</section>
